## Future ideas

- nostalgia block that changes unicode to bytes, division back to integer division, imports to relative
    - should work both as decorator and with statement
    - extra points for following options (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html):
        - disable generators
        - disable with statements
- class decorator or metaclass for implicit self (unless this has been done to death by others)
- subjective truth (stochastic bools) (not really possible in python 3 )
- experiment with jupyter notebook
- Closure vars
    - TODO: example of using with stdlib?
    - TODO: example of using `get_closure_variable`
    - TODO: example of using `get_closure_variable` with `set_closure_variables` to deal with nested closures..
      or does it work like that?
